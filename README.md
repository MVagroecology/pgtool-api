# Public Goods Tool
## Background
The PG Tool was built to allow researchers and land managers alike to easily identify the public
goods that are being created on their land and through data collected under various indicators. The
tool was also built with flexibility and adaptability in mind, with numerous custom versions being
built over the years to address specific research interests.

Further details about the history and use of the PG Tool can be found at
https://www.organicresearchcentre.com/our-research/research-project-library/public-goods-tool/.
This API, developed in collaboration with [MVARC](https://mvarc.eu/), is the
latest iteration based upon the original PG Tool v3.1 Excel-based farm sustainability assessment tool created by [Organic Research Centre](https://www.organicresearchcentre.com) in 2011. It offers a new programming interface that makes this tool accessible and available for developers and researchers to build upon-it, retaining the adaptability that has driven its wide use in the past.

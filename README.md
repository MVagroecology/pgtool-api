# Public Goods Tool
## Background
The PG Tool was built to allow researchers and land managers alike to easily identify the public goods that are being created on their land through data collected under various indicators. The tool was also built with flexibility and adaptability in mind, with numerous custom versions being built over the years to address specific research interests.

This API, developed in collaboration with [MVARC](https://mvarc.eu/), is the
latest iteration based upon the original PG Tool v3.1 Excel-based farm sustainability assessment tool created by [Organic Research Centre](https://www.organicresearchcentre.com). It offers a new programming interface that makes this tool accessible and available for developers and researchers to build upon-it, retaining the adaptability that has driven its wide use in the past.

For developers there is further infromation about the design and future development of the PG Tool available [here](https://github.com/organicresearchcentre/pgtool-gui/blob/main/PG%20Tool%20Online%20Development.md).

If you are looking for a running example of the PG Tool with a web interface then please check the [GUI](https://github.com/organicresearchcentre/pgtool-gui).

## How to use

### Webpage <script> import

Within a .html webpage just import the script in order to use it. There are two options:

- Download the pgtool.js file and import it directly;
- Use a third-party cdn service (like [jsdelivr.com](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)), as in the following example:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/organicresearchcentre/pgtool-api@master/pgtool.js"></script>`
